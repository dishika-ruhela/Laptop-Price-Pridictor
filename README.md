# Laptop Price Predictor
## This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting laptop prices based on various specifications and requirements. The goal is to build a model that can estimate the price of a laptop given ##its features.

# Project Overview
### In this project, I utilized several data science and machine learning libraries to analyze the dataset and build predictive models. The following steps were taken:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized the data.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable.
## Feature Engineering: Created new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
## Model Building: Built several regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and more.
## Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics and selected the best-performing model.
# Libraries Used
## NumPy: For numerical computations.
## Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
## Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
## Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
## Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
# Key Features
## Data Visualization: Insights into the dataset using various plots and charts.
## Multiple Regression Models: Implementation of different regression techniques.
## Model Performance Comparison: Detailed comparison of model performance metrics.
